# Vocabulary
WPF-App that assists in quickly producing Japanese-English vokabulary lists related to specific texts

Dear readers of this github.com Website!

Intention

I am thinking of producing a WPF-App that helps the user study the Japanese language by assisting the user in his producing of individual vocabulary lists as a base for his personal studies.

Source

The wonderful Japanese-English dictionary that would be used for the new App had been produced in a collaborative effort of some great people, long before I got to know the intensely useful Website that I was using for learning Japanese.

The link to the Website is http://wwwjdic.org/. Every WWW-Site, Software, Dictionary or Vocabulary List that uses the database must contain an easy-to-spot Acknowledgement like the following: 

“Sample Acknowledgement for a WWW Site

My Development Environment

The production of the WPF-App will be realized as part of the final project of a C# software developer course at WIFI WIEN institute in Vienna. The WIFI WIEN institute holds qualification courses for adults who want to increase their professional skills. I am expressing my acknowledgement to the contributions of our instructors, Mr. Christopher Benge, Mr. Florian Pöhr and Mrs. Michaela Pum, in alphabetical order. The website of the institute can be found at http://www.wifiwien.at. I am also grateful to my husband, Mr. Dr. Christian Weninger, for his assistance in solving Computer programming problems.

About me

I am living in Vienna, Austria, and I am learning Japanese as a hobby. The http://wwwjdic.org/ website has been of immense help for me. I hope that it will be maintained for a long time. Sometimes I missed using the website when there was no internet-connection. To help using the vocabulary-database when there is no internet-connection, I am intending to build a WPF-App. 

Description of the planned WPF-App

The WPF-App would display a Japanese text of the user’s choice that the user has retrieved from a website or from some other electronic storage medium and that he has loaded into the WPF-App. It would allow the user to mark unknown vocabulary in the text on the screen using the computer’s mouse. The new WPF-App would then search the highlighted vocabulary in a database derived from JMdict_e.txt file and show the results in a display list. 

Next, the user would have the option of selecting the vocabulary that he would like to remember and compose an individually selected vocabulary list using the results. The user would have the choice of editing the individually produced vocabulary list, like for example adding translations retrieved from other sources, adding translations into his mother language or deleting parts of the results. Then the user would be able to save and print his own vocabulary list or send it via e-mail to his mobile phone, home or some other recipient. The purpose of the WPF-App is to reduce the number of Strg-C and Strg-V keyboard interactions that would be necessary in order to produce a vocabulary list when using Microsoft Word and a Web-Browser. Moreover, it would provide an offline copy of the dictionary, so that it can be used when there is no internet connection.

If you feel that the WPF-App that I am intending to produce hurts any copyrights, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I am intending to make life easier and more comfortable and do not want to hurt any copyrights.

Yours sincerely

Sylvia Weninger
